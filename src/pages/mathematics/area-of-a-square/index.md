## Area of a Square

A square is a shape with four equal sides. Therefore, to find the area you may either multiply the length of one side by the other side or square the length of one side. 

Example:
You have a square that is 3 inches long and 3 inches wide- in other words 3 inches on all sides. To find the area you may either take 3 and multiply by 3 to get 9 (3x3=9) or you may take 3 and square it (3^2 = 9.)
